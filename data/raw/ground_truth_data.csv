"Listed Power Unit Components” (LPUC) are PU components whose design, manufacture and
Intellectual Property is owned and/or controlled by a single PU Manufacturer or its agents on an exclusive basis (including, without limitation, the PU components identified as such in
Appendix 3)"
"Each Power Unit Manufacturer must submit one homologation dossier which applies to all
Competitors it intends to supply. Only the fuel specification, the engine oil specification and
Power Unit wirings may differ between Competitors. In this event they must be declared
separately in the dedicated sections of the homologation dossier."
"The FIA reserves the right to:
a. Revoke the ADUO if the performance demonstrated by the PU Manufacturer after the
first five Competitions is inconsistent with that measured during the first five
Competitions.
b. Take measures, to its absolute discretion, if the resulting upgrades implemented by
the PU Manufacturer under the provisions of Article 3.2 of this Appendix give that PU
Manufacturer an advantage that is deemed to be unfair in comparison to PU
Manufacturers who were not awarded any ADUO. Such measures will be discussed in
good faith with all PU Manufacturers."
"The PU supply perimeter listed in the corresponding column of Appendix 3 of the Technical
Regulations shall be supplied at the maximum price of 15 million euros, adjusted for
Indexation. For the purpose of this article, Indexation has the meaning indicated, and will be
calculated pursuant to the methodology set forth, in Appendix 1 of the Formula 1 Power Unit
Financial Regulations. The supply of additional goods or services not listed in the Appendix
hereto (which shall be agreed between the PU Manufacturer and the Competitor) shall incur
additional charges, the amount of which shall be based on the usages and practices generally
recognised and respected in the market."
"In the case of Competitors participating in the 2022-2025 Championships (and in relation to
whom Article 2.2.1 is inapplicable), the FIA invites each such Competitor to nominate in
writing to the FIA their Prospective Supplier(s) within 90 days of: (i) the first publication of
these Technical Regulations; or (ii) entering into a commercial or supply agreement with its
pre-existing Fuel and/or Engine Oil Supplier in relation to any of the 2026-2030
Championships, whichever is earlier.
Following the nomination of the Prospective Supplier(s), the FIA will invite such Prospective
Supplier(s) to enter into a Prospective Supplier Non-Assert Agreement in the form prescribed
by the FIA, pursuant to the provisions of Articles 2.1.2 – 2.1.5 above. Should a Prospective
Supplier fail to enter into the Prospective Supplier Non-Assert Agreement within 30 days of
being invited to do so by the FIA, the FIA will inform the Competitor whether, as a result of
that failure, they will be required to find a different Fuel and/or Engine Oil Supplier.
Each Competitor has the right to change their Fuel and/or Engine Oil Supplier at any time,
provided the provisions of this Article and Articles 2.1.2 – 2.1.5 are met in relation to any
subsequent Prospective Supplier."
"An Automotive Manufacturer is a Manufacturer of at least one model of automobile (as
defined in the Code) that has produced at least 3,000 units during the past 12 months."
"a. All Power Unit components used in Formula One cars shall be classified as:
i.a Listed Power Unit Component (LPUC);
ii.a Standard Supply Power Unit Component (SSPUC);
iii.an Open-Source Power Unit Component (OSPUC); or
iv.
a Defined Specification Power Unit Component (DSPUC),
each as defined in Articles 18.3-18.6 (inclusive).
b. Unless otherwise specified, or determined by the FIA, such components/equipment
will be classified as LPUC.
c. In cases of doubt, the FIA should be consulted and shall determine the classification of
a particular PU component or piece of equipment, should that differ from the default
classification mentioned in Article 18.2.1(b) above."
"In the event that the initial boiling point test (ASTM D7500) suggests the presence of
compounds with a boiling point of less than 210°C the sample will be further analysed by
GCMS. The total of any components with boiling points less than 210°C must not exceed 0.5%
m/m.
The engine oil must not contain any organometallic petrol additives or other octane boosting
petrol additives."
"Engine oil samples taken during a Competition will be checked for conformity by using a
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) technique, which will compare the sample taken with that
submitted at the start of the Competition. Samples which differ from the reference engine oil
in a manner consistent with fuel dilution, engine fluids contamination and oil ageing as a
result of normal engine operation, will be considered to conform. Samples which differ from
the reference engine oil in a manner consistent with the mixing with other engine oils, which
have been approved by the FIA for use by the team at a Competition, will be deemed to
comply, provided that the adulterant oils are in total present at no more than 10% in the
sample. This tolerance will also be applicable for the mixing with the approved dyno engine
oil but only for a new engine during the competition at which it is first used. However, the FIA
retains the right to subject the oil sample to further testing at an FIA approved laboratory."
"A base stock is a lubricant component that is produced by a single
manufacturer. Base stocks may be manufactured using a variety of different
processes including but not limited to distillation, solvent refining, hydrogen
processing, oligomerization, esterification, and rerefining."
